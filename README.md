# Full-Cycle-ETL-Analytics-with-Google-Analytics-and-Snowflake

**Project Overview**

Welcome to my project repository, where data meets innovation. This isn't just a portfolio website traffic analysis; it's a journey through the modern data landscape, leveraging the prowess of Google Analytics and the robustness of Snowflake to derive actionable insights. As a data science professional, I believe in going beyond the norm. This project demonstrates my proactive approach to not only showcase my skills but also to keep track of how my portfolio resonates with audiences and recruiters alike.

**What Sets This Project Apart**

Innovative Tracking: While most professionals stop at creating a portfolio, I've integrated Google Analytics to gain real-time insights into traffic and engagement.
Advanced Data Handling: From custom ETL processes to complex analyses, I've crafted a Snowflake database to store and dissect every bit of data.
Insightful Visualizations: Charts and graphs aren't just for aesthetics; they tell a story of user interaction and engagement with my portfolio.
Strategic Feedback Loop: This isn't just about gathering data; it's about refining strategies, whether for job applications or professional visibility.
